# VIRTUAL REALITY (VR)

## Purpose 

Virtual Reality (VR) is designed to create immersive, computer-generated environments where users can interact in a simulated 3D world using headsets, sensors, and controllers. 

The purpose is to enhance engagement and understanding through experiential learning.
Provide safe, scalable environments for training and simulation.
Expand access to high-quality education and IT systems regardless of location.

## Usage of VR

-**In Education**:

Immersive Learning: Students can explore places, time periods, or systems that are inaccessible in real life (e.g., ancient civilizations, human body).

STEM Education: VR helps visualize complex concepts in physics, biology, and chemistry.
Special Education: Supports students with learning difficulties by offering alternative, interactive learning methods.
Virtual Labs: Enables experimentation in science without the risks or material costs of physical labs.
